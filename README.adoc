= DevOps Training Platform

This is (hopefully) a working example of a delivery pipeline using

. Jenkins
. A generic build slave with only Docker installed
.. so we don't build on master
. Most commonly used build tools, meaning
.. Maven
.. NPM
. A fairly generic project
.. https://github.com/cachavezley/devops-training-app[a TODO list]
.. with a frontend and a backend
. a project-defined pipeline

== Prerequisites
* https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/[Docker]
* https://www.vagrantup.com/[Vagrant]

== Launch
In order to launch your platform all you have to do is execute the following script

[source,bash]
----
./setup.sh
----

this will

. launch a Vagrant Box to be used as a Jenkins Slave
.. this box installs Docker on launch
. build a Jenkins Docker Image with all the necessary plugins already installed
. launch a container using this newly-built image
. download the https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+CLI[Jenkins Client] from this instance
. create the credentials in Jenkins
.. we use Vagrant's private key (found in `.vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox/private_key`) as Jenkins key also
. create the node in Jenkins
.. we use the private IP (`192.168.33.10`) we set in the Vagrantfile to connect the Vagrant Box
. use a local folder `data/` localted inside this workspace (where you cloned this project) to locally stock Jenkins files (to survive restarts)

== Cleanup

[source,bash]
----
./cleanup.sh
